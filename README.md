## üöÄ User Flow

1.  **Register/Login:** A user creates a new account or logs in.
2.  **Get Token:** Upon successful login, the server sends a JWT to the client.
3.  **Store Token:** The token is stored in the browser (e.g., in Redux state or Local Storage).
4.  **Add Book:** The user navigates to the "Add Book" page, fills in the form, and uploads a cover image.
5.  **Image Processing:** The server receives the request, uses `Multer` to process the image, and then uploads it to `Cloudinary`.
6.  **Save Data:** `Cloudinary` returns an image URL. The server saves this URL along with other book data to the `MongoDB` database.
7.  **Display:** All books are displayed on the main page, with filtering options available.
8.  **Contact:** Clicking a book shows its details and the owner's contact information.
9.  **Manage:** The user can visit their profile to see and delete their own books.
